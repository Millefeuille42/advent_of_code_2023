# Millefeuille's Advent of Code 2023

## Letting Fate Decide
I've spiced up this challenge by tying 12 different programming languages to a d12.
Each day, I roll the dice to pick a language for that day's challenge.
Here are the languages I've linked to the die:

1. Go
2. Rust
3. Bash
4. C++
5. C#
6. JavaScript/TypeScript
7. Python
8. Assembly (any architecture)
9. OCaml
10. Lua
11. Perl
12. Kotlin

I might not tackle every daily challenge on its release day.

## Daily Rolls
Here's what I've rolled for each day:

- Day 1: Go
- Day 2: JavaScript/TypeScript
- Day 3: C++
