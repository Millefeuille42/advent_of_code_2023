# Millefeuille's Advent of Code 2023

See https://adventofcode.com/

## Guidelines
I have mapped 12 languages (of which I have a variable amount of knowledge) to a d12 and will let fate
decide which language I will do every day.

1. go
2. rust
3. bash
4. c++
5. c#
6. js/ts
7. python
8. ASM (1 architecture au choix)
9. OCaml
10. Lua
11. Perl
12. Kotlin

I will certainly not do every dayly challenge the said day.

## Picks
Here are the picks for every day

- Day 1: Go
- Day 2: JS / TS
- Day 3: C++
